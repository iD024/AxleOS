# AxleOS
Axle OS: The AI-powered operating system for intelligent fleet management, leveraging digital twin simulations for predictive maintenance and operational analytics.

**The Central Operating System for Intelligent Fleet Management**

Axle OS is a production-grade, scalable SaaS platform designed to replace uncertainty in fleet management with foresight and insight. It acts as a dedicated team of digital experts assigned to every vehicle, working 24/7 to predict failures, diagnose root causes, and monitor operational safety.

Our revolutionary approach is powered by a synthetic data engine using the **BeamNG.drive** simulator. This allows us to train our AI models on millions of miles of simulated data, including rare and critical failure events that are impossible to capture in the real world.

## üéØ The Problem We Solve

Traditional fleet management is fundamentally inefficient, caught between two undesirable choices:

-   **Reactive Maintenance:** Fixing components *after* they fail, leading to costly unplanned downtime, schedule disruptions, and safety risks.
-   **Scheduled Maintenance:** Adhering to fixed service intervals, often resulting in the unnecessary replacement of healthy parts or failing to prevent breakdowns that occur between checks.

Axle OS eliminates this operational blind spot, creating a more reliable, efficient, and secure fleet operation.

## ‚ú® Core Features

Axle OS is built on three integrated pillars of intelligence, each powered by a specialist agent in our **AI Crew**.

| Feature                                   | Core Question It Answers                  | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîÆ **The Forecaster (Predictive Maintenance)** | _"When will this component fail?"_         | Leverages real-time and historical sensor data to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical vehicle components.            |
| üîé **The Detective (Root Cause Analysis)** | _"Why does this problem keep happening?"_  | Investigates recurring faults to identify systemic issues‚Äîfrom faulty supplier parts to inefficient operational patterns‚Äîand recommends solutions. |
| üëÅÔ∏è **The Watcher (Behavioral Analytics)** | _"Is everything operating as it should?"_ | Uses UEBA principles to learn the normal behavior of every driver and vehicle, flagging statistically significant anomalies that could indicate safety risks or inefficiencies. |

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

Axle OS is built on a modern, cloud-native microservices architecture designed for scalability and resilience.

-   **Frontend:** A responsive Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React**.
-   **Backend:** A set of independent microservices built in **Python (FastAPI)**, communicating asynchronously via a **RabbitMQ** message broker.
-   **AI & ML:** The AI Crew is orchestrated by **CrewAI**. Models are trained using **Scikit-learn** and **PyTorch**, tracked with **MLflow**, and served via a dedicated **ML Inference Service**.
-   **Data Platform:** A robust data pipeline ingests data into an **S3 Data Lake**, processes it, and serves it from a **PostgreSQL** database and a **Snowflake** data warehouse.
-   **Infrastructure:** The entire system is containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated on **Kubernetes (EKS)**, with infrastructure managed as code using **Terraform**.
